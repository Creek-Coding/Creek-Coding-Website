        <p>Created by students in the Houston area, Creek Coding strives to promote CS literacy through a variety of programs. We focus especially on addressing the growing number of students wanting to learn how to code by sharing our knowledge with those around us.</p>
        <h1>Our Philosophy: Anyone Can Learn To Code</h1>
        <p>We believe that anyone should be able to have access to high quality instructional content to learn to code from scratch.
            We know that simply reading textbooks isn't the way to learn coding. It's boring and you make slow progress.
            Aiming to teach through <b>Project Based Learning</b>, we practice and learn new skills by making. At Hack Club,
            students are encouraged to build projects every week. Lightbulb Education Code provides high-quality,
            beginner focused
            tutorials on how to make simple but fun projects.</p>
        <h1>Why you should learn how to code</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>It helps teach problem solving and critical thinking skills.</li>
            <li>It turns you from a consumer into a creator, empowering you to change the world.</li>
            <li>It's fun! (Oh and it's a very lucrative career path)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Of course, coding isn't for everyone. But you won't know until you <b>try</b>. And even if you don't choose
        it as a career path, you'll still have a valuable skill for the future</p>
        <h1>How to get involved</h1>
