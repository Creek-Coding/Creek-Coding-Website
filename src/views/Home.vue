        <p>Created by students based in the Houston area, Creek Coding strives to promote CS literacy through after
            school
            programs like Hack Club, video instruction through byteCode, and online beginner focused tutorials through
            Lightbulb
            Education Code.</p>
        <h1>Our Philosophy: Anyone Can Learn To Code</h1>
        <p>We believe that anyone should be able to have access to high quality, instructional content to learn to code
            from scratch.
            We know that simply reading textbooks isn't the way to learn coding. It's boring and you make slow progress.
            Aiming to teach through <b>Project Based Learning</b>, we practice and learn new skills by making new
            projects. At Hack Club,
            students are encouraged to build projects every week. Lightbulb Education Code provides high-quality,
            beginner focused
            tutorials on how to make simple but fun projects.</p>
        <h1>Why you should learn how to code</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>It helps tech problem solving and critical thinking skills.</li>
            <li>It turns you from a consumer into a creator, empowering you to change the world.</li>
            <li>It's fun! (Oh and its a very lucrative career path)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Of course, coding isn't for everyone. But you won't know until you <b>try</b>. And even if you don't choose
        it as a career path, it can still benefit you immensely in the soft skills department.</p>
